My hubby's cousin's friend's uncle was in March of The Penguins.&He helped chew the food for the child actors
One of the guys on the third floor is amazing with computer networks.&I heard he even has webbed feet.
My son caught a starfish last night, all on his won.&He's just like his dad, I couldn't be prouder.
I don't know waddle do with myself if I ever lose this job.&The atmosphere and benefits here aren't topped anywhere else on the continent.
Iâ€™m having a whale of a time with this company.
Puuut a feather in his cap&And called it macaroooni!
Mr.Popper expects much too much.&I'm a free spirit, I'm wild!&He can't contain me!
