Beak careful on the glue-testing floor.&Workers get stuck there all the time.&Even our Chief Emperor Penguin got stuck once.
My aunt arctica is coming over today!&Whenever she comes over we always have a whale of a time.&Like last time when she huddled with us for 4 hours.&Gooood times, man.
Our new product idea is great!&igloos huge wings made of balsa wood, carbon fiber and foam&to penguins, finally letting them experience flight.
My head is swimming with ideas for our ice-mining business.&I heard pure ice doesn't conduct electricity.&That means it's an insulator.&That means it could insulate my house!
Be nice and keep your cool.&Jack Nicholson's been helping me with that.
I feel like a chinstrap on monday,&A king on thursday,&An emperor on friday,&And a dodo on sunday.
My feet are happy right now.&I could almost break out into rap and dance.
