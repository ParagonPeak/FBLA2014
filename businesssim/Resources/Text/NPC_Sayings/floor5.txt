If we don't educate our kids more they'll start falling behind other Animalia.&Fish schools are what we should strive for in education.&The Asian Carp are a great example.
We've had to sit through a lot of corporate meetings after&one of our hiring managers was accused of discrimination.&Throughout all his years here, he never hired a single Galapagos penguin.&I think it's ridiculous though.&No Galapagos penguins live around here.
Flying these days is such a hassle.&It used to be that you could just catch the Gull wherever you wanted.&They wrapped that up in red tape after one of the Gulls ate one of the Kiwi 'Little Penguins."
Someone tried telling me that they're working on penguin flight in R&D.&I'll believe that when penguins fly.
