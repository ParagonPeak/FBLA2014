When I was a kid things weren't so easy.&I rode my icicle 7 nautical miles each way&just to get to school.
I'm gonna get yoked at the gym after work.&Gotta work those dorsals, y'know?
Flippers are NOT a substitute for spatulas.& I learned that the hard way.&Maybe 20 years from now our R&D will have developed opposable thumbs.
I was late to work today because of transportation troubles.&The mechanic said my Gentoo blew a seal.&Sure enough, the poor thing was missing its icecap.&I replaced it and it swam just like new.
Hey!&Ice to meet you.&Iâ€™m Steve.
